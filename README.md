# Kickstartr v0.1

Kickstartr is a boilerplate webapp with a golang backend server, angularjs client app and grunt based build system. It is directly copied and tweaked from [ngbp](https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp).

### To Use
* Clone this repo
* edit package.json and update name|version
* edit bower.json and update name|version
* setup dependencies
```sh
$ npm install
$ bower install
```
* replace contents of README.md with your project's details.

### Still TODO
* Integrate testing
* Integrate releases with [bake](https://github.com/singhsaysdotcom/bake)
* Add a boilerplate logo maybe.
